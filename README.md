#C-Sharp-BestAppEver

I pay Â£4.20p monthly to host this generic C# website for you employers to view at: www.321191.co.uk in the hope that you will be very impressed.

Technologies used:
C#, ASP.Net, MS SQL Server 2014, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap Javascript. IDE is Visual Studio Community 2017 RC.

I built this App so that data can be Inserted, Updated and Deleted to the Customer, Order and Product tables using a frontend ASP.Net website and a backend MS SQL Database.

Please see my www.facebook.com/m2lawrence for all my great screen shots of all the technologies that I've self taught. Also here: https://goo.gl/344XPJ 

For a great demo please offer me a face interview asap?

Kind regards, Michael Lawrence BSc (HONS)

Note for security I have blanked out all the security details in this app, and I am currently working on another app that has a user in the App Pool and then all security is placed into the Web Config File on my computer and is hidden/protected by a FireWall to STOP any hackers hacking into my SQl Connection strings/signals as they are sent over the internet.
