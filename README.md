,# C-Sharp-BestAppEver
I have hosted this website for you to see at: www.321191.co.uk

Technologies used:
C#, ASP.Net, SQL Server, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap Javascript.

I built this App so that data can be Inserted, Updated and Deleted to the Customer, Order and Product tables using a frontend ASP.Net website and a backend SQL Database.

Please see my www.facebook.com/m2lawrence for all my great screen shots of all the technologies that I've self taught. Also here: https://goo.gl/344XPJ 

If you want to see this great C Sharp code, then please give me a face interview asap?

Kind regards,
